Project Machbarschaft was created in the context of [WirVsVirus Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) hosted by the German Government. Our pitch video can be found [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YJ0I0dMmWg). We also have a [Devpost Profile](https://devpost.com/software/einanrufhilft) and a website [machbarschaft.jetzt](https://machbarschaft.jetzt/).


Our simple website serves as a central information platform for interested volunteers. The purely static website machbarschaft.jetzt is based on a bootstrap theme, which was implemented with the technologies HTML5 and CSS3 (SCSS). A CMS has not been implemented yet. Since the website can be called up in any situation, we attached great importance to a responsive layout. The website serves not only to recruit new volunteers for our native apps but also to promote our entire concept to future supporters. Since our target group of people seeking help is mainly informed via analogue channels, supporters can download an attractive MACHBARSCHAFT flyer which can be hung up in the neighbourhood or distributed in mailboxes. This way, both target groups - volunteers and people seeking help - can be addressed in parallel.
The website is hosted using GitHub Pages.


[New Age](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/new-age/) is a web app landing page theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
